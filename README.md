See [website](https://Boolf.zone).

Boolf is a community-driven, decentralized, and open-source story-telling smart contract application controlled by [BoolfDAO].

Members can propose and vote on new stories and sub-stories to be immortalized on-chain forever. The stories on this website are generated from a smart contract on Juno mainnet.

The BoolfDAO token holders can vote on the direction of the story, evolving the Floob universe to their liking.

You can read the first story, [What happened when Boolf had soup](https://boolf.zone/stories/0).

This project is created and maintained by -. It is intended to be a fun and educational project personally, and an experiment in decentralized story-telling for the Juno community. Never buy BOOLF, just ask and we will mint.
